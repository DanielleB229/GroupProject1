## Project Description-
SafeHarbor

Our application seeks to help users locate homes in safe areas near you. Safest and most affordable application for you to find your dream home. The implementation of the Google API serves to provide geographical locations for potential homes. With these individual locations we can use the Crime Score REST API to rate the safety of that location.
